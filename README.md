# Image_Classification

In this project, we classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. Here, we preprocessed the data, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, we inspect their predictions on the sample images.

# Project

In ,this project we had to build and run a [Convolutional Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network)using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and use it to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). The project was written in Python (on a Jupyter Notebook).
